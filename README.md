# Multiple Linear Regression – Bike Sharing Assignment
>Demonstration to build a multiple linear regression model

BoomBikes is a US-based company which provides bike-sharing services. The user borrows the bike on a short-term basis for a price or free. The user can take the bike from a computer-controlled "dock" where he enters the payment information, and the system unlocks the bike. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system. 

Due to Corona pandemic, BoomBikes suffered considerable dips in its revenue. As such the company wants to come up with a business plan to boost its revenue post-lockdown period.

The company aims to understand the demand for shared bikes in American market so as to stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Essentially, the company wants —

-	To identify the factors that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

-	The accuracy of the model with which such factors can predict the bike demands.

The company has contracted a consulting firm which has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 
The data contains information on certain parameters from meteorological surveys (ex – seasons, weathers conditions, temperature, humidity etc. on day of usage of shared bikes) and people's styles (ex. – usage of bike on holiday, working day, weekday etc.). The dataset also contains number of shared-bike users (registered, casual and cnt – total of reg. and casual users). 

We will be using this dataset to build a Multiple Linear Regression Model to determine the significant factors for shared-bikes demand (i.e., ‘cnt’ column in the dataset). We will also look into the accuracy of the model as it is one of the important factors for company’s business plan.
